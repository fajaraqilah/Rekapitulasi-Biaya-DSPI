I need to update the SVG icons for two specific menu items in my sidebar as the previous ones were not clear enough:

1.  **"Beban Biaya Tamu":** The current icon doesn't clearly represent "guest" or "visitor" expenses. A better alternative would be an icon representing a **person staying overnight**, **hotel/accommodation**, or a **welcome guest**. Consider an SVG for a **bed**, **key**, or a **person with a suitcase**.
    *   **Suggested Icon:** An SVG of a **bed** (representing accommodation costs for guests) would be very appropriate. Something like the outline of a bed with a person lying down or a simple bed frame shape.
    *   **Alternative:** An SVG of a **key** (hotel key) or a **person with a suitcase**.

2.  **"Beban Biaya Rapat":** The current icon doesn't clearly represent "meeting" expenses. A better alternative would be an icon representing a **conference**, **meeting room**, or **group discussion**.
    *   **Suggested Icon:** An SVG of a **conference room**, **meeting table**, or a **group of people in a circle** (representing a discussion/meeting) would be more suitable.
    *   **Alternative:** An SVG of a **presentation screen** or a **video conference** icon (like a video camera with multiple people).

Please replace the inline SVG code for these two specific sidebar menu items with more representative icons based on the suggestions above. Ensure the new SVGs maintain the same Tailwind classes for size (`w-5 h-5`) and any other styling applied to the other icons for consistency.
