I want to redesign the login page to improve its appearance and user experience. The current page is functional but lacks visual branding and a polished layout.

Please implement the following changes:

1.  **Add PTPN 1 Logo:**
    *   Use the logo file `logo ptpn1.png` located in the `assets` folder (`C:\Users\ASUS\Documents\rincian-biaya-spi\assets\logo ptpn1.png`).
    *   Display the logo prominently on the login page, ideally centered above the login form or in a dedicated branding area.
    *   Ensure the logo is appropriately sized and responsive (looks good on different screen sizes).

2.  **Improve Overall Layout and Styling:**
    *   Create a more modern and visually appealing layout for the login form itself (email, password fields, login button).
    *   Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the form container (e.g., add padding, background color, border radius, subtle shadow, center it on the page).
    *   Enhance the styling of the input fields (e.g., focus states, padding, border styles).
    *   Improve the styling of the login button (e.g., color, hover effects, padding).
    *   Ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
    *   Consider adding subtle background elements or a background color/image if appropriate, but keep the focus on the login form.

3.  **Maintain Functionality:**
    *   Ensure all existing login functionality remains intact.
    *   The form submission and authentication process should work exactly as before.

The goal is to create a professional-looking login page that incorporates the PTPN 1 branding and provides a better first impression for users.
